The model is then evaluated using the time dependent\n    ROC curve which is also estimated using pseudo-observations. The method and results will \n    appear in a forthcoming paper. \nLicense: GPL\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nDepends:\n  survival,\n  SuperLearner,\n  pseudo,\n  testthat\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\n",
